## üõ† Local Development

1. Setup environment variables:

   ```env
   # .env.local

   # Analytics
   GA_TRACKING_ID="1234"

   # Note: I wasn't allowed to publicly share the contact information on Github.
   # This was a condition for making the code available open source
   # Don't ask me why because the website is public anyway but who cares lol.
   CONTACT_PHONE_NUMBER="+12 3456 789012"
   CONTACT_FIRST_NAME="Jeff"
   CONTACT_LAST_NAME="Rocks"
   CONTACT_ADDRESS_STREET="Muster-Street"
   CONTACT_ADDRESS_STREET_NUMBER=3
   CONTACT_ADDRESS_POST_CODE=12345
   CONTACT_ADDRESS_CITY="Jeffhausen"
   CONTACT_SURROUNDING="Jeffhausen / Jeffcity"
   CONTACT_EMAIL="jeff@jeff.com"
   CONTACT_HOMEPAGE="https://www.jeff.de"
   ```

2. Start the Remix dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The Remix dev server starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on
file changes

3. Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you should be
   ready to go!

## üì¨ Deployment

This website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### üì° Netlify Setup

1. Install the [Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/):

```sh
npm i -g netlify-cli
```

If you have previously installed the Netlify CLI, you should update it to the
latest version:

```sh
npm i -g netlify-cli@latest
```

2. Sign up and log in to Netlify:

```sh
netlify login
```

3. Make your local repository known to Netlify via the `Site ID`.

```sh
netlify init
# or
netlify link
```

### üéâ Deploy to Netlify

There are two ways to deploy this app to Netlify, you can either go via the Git
Repository linked to Netlify and have it auto deploy changes to Netlify
(**recommended**), or you can deploy your app manually. If you've followed the
setup instructions already, all you need to do is run this:

```sh
# Local Preview deployment
netlify deploy --build

# Local Production deployment
netlify deploy --build --prod
```

## ü§î Good to Know

### üñå Stylesheet generation

> -> Sass -> Tailwind

```bash
concurrently \"pnpm run generate:sass:css --watch\" \"pnpm run generate:tailwind:css --watch\"
```

The Sass Compiler watches all `.scss` files to give us the opportunity to create
complex styles that Tailwind might not be able to handle. These files will be
compiled to `.css` files which then can be imported in the Component/s.

```ts
import styles from './blog.css';

export function links() {
  return [{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: styles }];
}
```

The Tailwind Compiler only watches the compiled (from Sass) main `root.css` file
and compiles it to `tailwind.root.css` (adds used Tailwind styles, ..) which is
imported in the root of the project.

      should be enough for now) [ ] Make mobile navbar smaller (by just showing
      the Logo) when scrolling down (nice transition)
- [ ] Google Analytics
- [x] Impressum (based on:
      https://www.heilpraktikerausbildung-franken.de/impressum)
- [ ] Figure out why subdomains like `scan.domain.de` not working

</details>

<details>
<summary>Bug fixes</summary>

- [ ] Make Navigation Menu working again
- [ ] Font in PROD not loading

</details>

<details>
<summary>Workflow optimization</summary>

- [ ] Build EsLint plugin to simplyfy the extracting of inline Tailwind. Before
      running Plugin

  ```tsx
  const Container = () => {
    return (
      <div className="flex flex-row mx-8 items-center name:Container">
        {/* .. */}
      </div>
    );
  };
  ```

  After running Plugin

  ```tsx
  const Component = () => {
    return <div className={Container}>{/* .. */}</div>;
  };

  const Container = tss`flex flex-row mx-8 items-center`;
  ```
